# Bugs

This is a skeleton project for building clean applications on top of [Bun.js].
It leverages [DICC] for dependency injection.

This isn't a formal attempt at publishing my own application framework, but it
may well become one in the future. For now, it's just where I keep a template
to start new projects on.

[Bun.js]: https://bun.sh
[DICC]: https://cdn77.github.io/dicc/
